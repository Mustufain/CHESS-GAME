# CHESS-GAME

open the project in any Java IDE eg: Netbeans. It also contains database where user highscores are recorded or if you want to resume a game.
I have not included database here as I am unable to locate it. If error is popping then you can just comment out the part which I Connections.java.
If the issue is coming you can create an issue and I will look into that. Its a 2 player game.
